# Insights Dashboard

> Frontend dashboard that crowdsources sales, staffing, and catalog data from a network of non-competing small businesses (in the same sector) to provide actionable insights that benefit all member businesses. Created for the NCR challenge at HackGT 2020. Bootstrapped via `create-react-app`, and built using TypeScript and Emotion.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To view a live hosted version of the app, go to [https://insights-dashboard.netlify.app/](https://insights-dashboard.netlify.app/), which uses [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to host the static React application on their servers.

### ðŸ’» Running Locally

To run the app locally, make sure [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) is installed and then run:

```sh
yarn install
yarn start
```

This will start a development server at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
